# Generative AI Sentiment Analysis

> Sentiment Analysis on Generative AI in Twitter platform using IBM Granite Instructured

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

Many startups fail in the first few years due to lack of funding, poor business models, or market mismatch. Through this project, SSP (Startup Success Prediction) is developed as a system that uses classification learning to predict whether a startup will succeed or fail based on its key characteristics. This model aims to support investors and entrepreneurs in making more accurate and effective decisions.
